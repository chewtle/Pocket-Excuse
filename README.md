## 💡 Why Pocket Excuse?  

Most excuse apps generate random text with little thought. Pocket Excuse was designed differently:  
it focuses on *real-world use*. Excuses are short, natural, and easy to deliver. With tone options, history, and a built-in success rating system, you always have the right excuse in your pocket.
